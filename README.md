# Heart-Disease-Predictions

## The aim of this project is to build an ML model that can predict the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on the given features.

# FEATURES IN THE DATASET:

* age - age in years,

* sex - (1 = male; 0 = female),

* cp - chest pain type (1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic),

* trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital),

* chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl,

* fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false),

* restecg - resting electrocardiographic results,

* thalach - maximum heart rate achieved,

* exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no),

* oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest,

* slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment,

* ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy,

* thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect,

* target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no).
